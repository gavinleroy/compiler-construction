This directory contains VM tests that are meant to be run using [[https://github.com/simonmichael/shelltestrunner][shelltestrunner]].

When running these tests, the VM shelltest macro must be defined, and point to the executable of the VM to test. This means that the C VM can be tested as follows (after having been built with ~make~):
#+begin_src shell
  $ shelltest -D VM=../c/bin/vm .
#+end_src
while the Rust VM can be tested as follows (after having been built with ~cargo build --release~):
#+begin_src shell
  $ shelltest -D VM=../rust/target/release/l3vm .
#+end_src
