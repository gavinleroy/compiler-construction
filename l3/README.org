#+TITLE: The L₃ project

Welcome to the L₃ project, composed of an L₃ compiler, a virtual machine, a library and a few example programs. The directories are laid out as follows:

  - ~compiler~ :: contains the source code of the L₃ compiler,

  - ~vm~ :: contains the source code of the main version of the L₃ virtual machine (written in C),

  - ~vm-rust~ :: contains the source code of the Rust version of the L₃ virtual machine,

  - ~library~ :: contains the source code of the L₃ library,

  - ~examples~ :: contains a few example L₃ programs and benchmarks.

Most of these directories contain a ~README.org~ file with further information.
